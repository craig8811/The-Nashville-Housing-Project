# The-Nashville-Housing-Project
This data analytics project utilized SQL and Tableau to clean, explore and discover trends in the Nashville Housing Market. The data was thoroughly cleaned and then explored using SQL. After analyzing the insights during exploratory data analysis, we visualized these trends with Tableau to show key statistical indicators and trends for the Nashville metro area, segmented by municipality, property type, and seasonality.

We produced a map that visualizes the total housing units for the municipalities of the Nashville metro area. This provides a clear and concise representation of the units present across the region.

To give a thorough analysis, we produced two dashboards. One which focuses on sale prices and volume trends, while the other dashboard demonstrates sale price trends and how they are affected by property land use, bedroom and bathroom count and year-month seasonality. 

We give our thanks to TMTHYJAMES of Kaggle for openly sharing this data so we could use it in this analysis.
